"""
Hangman Program Algorithm
1. Prepare the Word List
Create a list called hangwords containing possible words for the game.

2. Import Modules
Import the random module to help pick a random word.

3. Choose a Word
Randomly select a word from hangwords and store it in chosen_word.
Convert chosen_word into a list of its letters (chosen_word_as_list).
Get the length of the word (dashcount).

4. Set Up the Game Board
Create a list called dashes with the same number of underscores as the letters in the word (to show unguessed letters).

5. Initialize Game Variables
Set replaced_letters_count to 0 (to track how many letters have been guessed).
Set lives_count to 6 (the number of wrong guesses allowed).

6. Main Game Loop
Repeat the following steps while the player still has lives and hasnâ€™t guessed all letters:
Check for Win/Loss:
If replaced_letters_count equals the number of letters, print a win message and break the loop.
If lives_count is 0, print a loss message and break the loop.
Ask for a Guess:
Prompt the player to input a letter (letter_guessed).
Check the Guess:
If the guessed letter is in the word:
Find all positions of that letter in the word.
For each position, if the dash is still "_", replace it with the guessed letter.
Print a success message and the updated dashes.
Increase replaced_letters_count by 1.
If the guessed letter is not in the word:
Print a failure message and the current dashes.
Decrease lives_count by 1.
Show Game Status:
Print the number of lives left.

7. End of Game
After the loop, the game ends with either a win or loss message.


Summary of Concepts Used
Lists: To store words, letters, and dashes.
Random: To pick a word randomly.
Loops: For repeating the guessing process.
Conditionals: To check guesses and game status.
User Input: To get guesses from the player.
String/List Manipulation: To update and display the game board.
